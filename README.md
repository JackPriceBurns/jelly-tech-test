# Jelly Back-end Tech Test

Thank you for taking the time to interview at Jelly!

*Please read this whole document before beginning any work.*

⏰ You should aim to spend around 2 hours on this challenge. We’re not expecting perfection, so feel free to make notes on areas you would improve and how you would approach them. These will make for great discussion points! The solution should, however, be functional and address the problem effectively.

🤖 We want to test you, not your AI, so please **write your own code without AI assistance**. Do however, make notes on where you think AI would have helped.

⁉️ The problem statement is intentionally vague - just make a note of any assumptions made.

📚 As this is a back-end focussed role, we have provided a basic front-end boilerplate to get you going quickly, **if you would prefer, you can start from scratch or change any of the defaults** as long as it still solves the problem**.**

🗣️ The next stage of this interview will be to look at what you’ve produced, not to pick it apart, but to have an open conversation around the technologies involved and the decisions you made along the way.

Good luck and have fun!

## Overview

The `/frontend` folder in the repository contains a **React + TypeScript + Vite application** with **Material UI** already configured.

The `/data` folder contains a data dump necessary for building your API

The `/backend` folder is where we expect you to build your API

## Requirements & Guidelines

💽 You have been provided with multiple files in `/data` - these give you various ingredients and their prices over time.

🕸️ We would like you to create a basic web application that allows you to create new recipes and view existing recipes, with their current cost to produce clearly displayed.

📈 We would like a GraphQL/TypeScript API created that allows you to achieve this.

📦 Feel free to use whatever packages you want to achieve your goal but just remember that we need to see what *you* are capable of, not package maintainers.

## Submission

1. **Commit your code** to a **private GitHub repo**.
2. **Add `JackPriceBurns` and `AndrewSpode`as collaborators** so we can access your work.
3. **Send an email** letting us know you’re done and ready for review.
